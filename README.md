# sniper
An ultra lightweight blog engine based on ASP.NET 5, with a JSON backend for metadata, and markdown for content.

## Why?
Blog engines have become complex and hungry. If you want to modify an engine or implement a simple, lightweight blog on your site, the resource usage and code complexity of existing engines is quite large.

Sniper is a content-first approach to blog engines and provides a super simplified code structure, with a minimal JSON based backend for metadata, and markdown for content.
